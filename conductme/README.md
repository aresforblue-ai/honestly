# ConductMe (Private Branch Placeholder)

This folder holds ConductMe, the frontend “conductor” for a local AI swarm with cryptographic proof-of-humanity.

Contents:

- `core/` — local GPU conductor for AI agent orchestration.
- `bridge/` — Semaphore + Groth16 root-of-trust bridge components.
- `testnet/` — local-only binaries, configs, and scripts for isolated testing.

For details, see `core/README.md`. Keep secrets and binaries out of public commits.
